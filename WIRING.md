# EmoDesk wiring

Everything runs from the ESP32-C3 Super Mini's USB-C port. Use a good 5 V / 1 A (or better) USB supply once the speaker is connected.

## Pin map

| Part | Part pin | Super Mini pin | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| SSD1306 OLED 128x64 (I2C) | VCC | 3V3 | Some modules accept 5 V too; 3.3 V is always safe |
| | GND | GND | |
| | SDA | GPIO 4 | |
| | SCL | GPIO 5 | |
| TTP223 touch | VCC | 3V3 | |
| | GND | GND | |
| | I/O (OUT) | GPIO 3 | Default jumpers: momentary, output HIGH when touched |
| MAX98357A amp (optional, add later) | VIN | 5V | Not 3V3 - the amp needs 5 V for full power |
| | GND | GND | |
| | BCLK | GPIO 6 | |
| | LRC | GPIO 7 | Sometimes labelled WS or LRCLK |
| | DIN | GPIO 10 | |
| | SD | GPIO 1 | Lets the firmware switch the amp off when silent (no hiss, less power). Leave unconnected if you prefer - the amp then stays on |
| | GAIN | not connected | 9 dB. See the gain table below |
| | + / - | Speaker | 4 Ω or 8 Ω, 2-3 W. Never connect either speaker wire to GND |
| On-board | Blue LED | GPIO 8 | Status light (alerts, sleep breathing) |
| On-board | BOOT button | GPIO 9 | Second control button after boot |
| Battery (ADC) | V_BAT | GPIO 0 | Optional voltage divider (e.g. 10k/10k) from battery positive to GND |

## Adding the speaker (MAX98357A)

```
     ESP32-C3 Super Mini                  MAX98357A                 Speaker
   +-------------------+              +--------------+            4-8 ohm 3W
   | 5V      ----------+------------->| VIN          |
   | GND     ----------+--+---------->| GND          |
   |                   |  |           |              |   (+)---->  +
   | GPIO6   ----------+--|---------->| BCLK         |   (-)---->  -
   | GPIO7   ----------+--|---------->| LRC          |
   | GPIO10  ----------+--|---------->| DIN          |
   | GPIO1   ----------+--|---------->| SD           |
   +-------------------+  |           | GAIN (open)  |
                          |           +--------------+
          470uF 10V cap:  5V (+) ---||--- GND (-)   placed close to the amp's VIN/GND
```

Then open the dashboard, go to **Sound** and switch on **Speaker installed**.

### Gain

| GAIN pin | Gain |
|---|---|
| 100 kΩ to GND | 15 dB (loudest) |
| GND | 12 dB |
| not connected | 9 dB (default) |
| VIN | 6 dB |
| 100 kΩ to VIN | 3 dB (quietest) |

Start at 9 dB with the dashboard volume around 40 %. Small desk speakers distort quickly at full power.

## Tips

- **Touch through the case.** The TTP223 works through up to about 3 mm of plastic or wood. Stick the pad flat against the inside wall with double-sided tape. Its ground plane should face away from your finger.
- **TTP223 jumpers.** Leave both solder jumpers open (momentary, active-high). If you closed jumper A (toggle mode) the gestures will not work.
- **Short I2C wires.** Keep the OLED wires under 15 cm. If the screen glitches, lower `OLED_I2C_HZ` in `config.h` to `400000`.
- **Hiss or buzz.** Add the 470 µF capacitor, keep audio wires away from the antenna end of the board, and route the speaker wires as a twisted pair.
- **Weak Wi-Fi.** Many Super Mini boards have a poorly tuned antenna. EmoDesk lowers transmit power by default, which counter-intuitively fixes most connection problems (Dashboard → System → Low transmit power). Keep metal and the speaker magnet away from the antenna.
- **Pins to avoid.** GPIO 2, 8 and 9 are strapping pins (8 and 9 are used for the LED and BOOT button on purpose). GPIO 20/21 are the UART. GPIO 0 and 1 are free if you want to extend the project later. GPIO 1 is used for the amp SD pin.
- **Powering from a battery.** Feed 5 V into the 5V pin (not 3V3) through a boost module, and add a switch. Expect roughly 80-120 mA idle with Wi-Fi, peaking well above 500 mA with loud audio.
